# Reworked Bee Origin 
A rebalanced version of the Custom Bee Origin Datapack by dandancon, compatible with the Origins Mod (Fabric).

**Apian**

Powers:
- Bumble: Toggleable power, allows you to levitate at leisure.
- Featherweight: Same as the Avian origin, you have a slow falling effect unless you sneak.
- Stinger: Attacking something directly will inflict a short poison effect. 
- Floral Diet: You can only eat honey. Standing in small flowers will replenish your saturation. Standing in tall flowers can give you a short regeneration effect and absorption for a while.
- Hydrophobia: Same as the Enderian and Blazeborn origins, you take damage on contact with water or rain. (However, you do not take damage from drinking it.)
- Homebody: Being exposed to the night sky will give you a hunger effect.
- Delicate Wings: You have 5 less hearts of health.

Cute Tip: Apians are very cute and have pollen particles c:

**Installation Instructions**

1. Download the repository as a .zip and unzip it.
2. Move the ``bee_origin`` folder inside the ``hive`` folder to the ``datapacks`` folder of the world you would like to use it in.
If you've already made the world, you can press edit on it and press open world folder to find it! 
You'll have to look for where you world folder is stored if this is on a server.
3. Start up your world/server and select the Apian origin to play as a bee!

**Changes**

Only read this section if you're interested!

Here is a list of the the balance and quality of life changes made to the original datapack:

- Added an icon for the datapack.
- Some power descriptions were made shorter so that it's quicker to read.
- Bumble gives you a practically infinite flight when you activate it, instead of 5 minutes, so you don't have to toggle it back on after using it for more than that.
- The slow falling power was changed to the Avian's Featherweight ability, to allow you to fall faster if you need to.
- The poison effect from stinger was changed to be more like the Bee mob, you give 6 seconds of Poison 1 instead of 3 seconds of poison 4.
- The stinger power was also modified so that it only triggers when you attack a mob directly. So, now it doesn't trigger when you use a bow or harming potions for example. 
- You can now eat honey instead of only being able to use flowers to regain saturation.
- Small flowers recover hunger twice as slow (but still give you saturation at the same rate).
- Tall flowers give 5 seconds of Regeneration 2 and 2 minutes of Absorption 1 (like golden apples), instead of 10 seconds of Regeneration 1, Absorption 1 and Resistance 1. This should help out with the low health by giving you the ability to get a free 2 heart buffer for  a while.
- The chance of getting this effect from tall flowers is still 25%, but this only happens every 5 seconds instead of every second, so you can't heal immediately.
- The Hydrophobia power was used instead of one made by the datapack as the damage to water effect was the same and it made more sense to reuse it.
- The Homebody power was made less of a disadvantage as getting Slowness 4 at night can be unfun, and having 5 hearts was already a huge one. It now only gives Hunger, which isn't too hard to get back with flowers.
- It also takes 5 seconds to apply the effect when you are exposed to the sky, and takes up to 10 seconds to go away, instead of toggling on and off as soon as you moved out of and into shelter.

Thank you for reading! I hope you'll have fun with the origin!
